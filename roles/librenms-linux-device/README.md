# librenms-linux-device role

This role configures a Linux server to be monitored via LibreNMS.

## Structure

Trying to set up the simplest role structure. From the docs:

> An Ansible role has a defined directory structure with seven main standard directories. You must include at least one of these directories in each role. **You can omit any directories the role does not use**.
