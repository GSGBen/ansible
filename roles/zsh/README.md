# zsh role

This role installs zsh how I like it, with oh-my-zsh and certain settings. Ansible needs to connect as the user you want oh-my-zsh set up for.

## Structure

Trying to set up the simplest role structure. From the docs:

> An Ansible role has a defined directory structure with seven main standard directories. You must include at least one of these directories in each role. **You can omit any directories the role does not use**.
